							<h1>Using Open Data to create real change in Leeds</h1>
							<p>Leeds Data Mill is a place for businesses and organisations to share their Open Data with anyone interested in creating real change in our day-to-day lives, and how we live, work and play in the city.</p>
						</header>
						<section>
							<h2>What is Open Data?</h2>
							<p>Open Data is information that&#8217;s collected and placed online for anyone to access and use in creative and inspiring ways. This information can be shaped to make a genuine difference to the services we rely on and give us the insight we&#8217;ve never had before &#8211; this makes it an incredibly powerful resource. </p>
							<p>Our goal is to bring together in one location a wealth of data in open formats, from which people can discover new information and explore what happens throughout the city.</p>
							<h2>Who creates Open Data?</h2>
							<p>Open Data is created by us, as individuals and groups, through our actions. It can include information from sports venues, shopping outlets, charities and Leeds City Council, to name just a few. Data within the site will never contain personal identifiable information &#8211; protecting individuals is a core principle of the project.</p>
							<p>When information from different sectors is combined it becomes an amazingly rich resource because it helps us identify connections. It&#8217;s through these connections that we can begin to see solutions for improving our lives and the lives of others.</p>
							<h2>Time to take action</h2>
							<p>Leeds Data Mill is the platform for us all to understand each other, and the city of Leeds, like never before. That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re challenging programmers, developers and hackers in Leeds to take this Open Data to create insights, and pave the way to build applications and services that benefit the whole city. </p>
							<p><i>The data is open. The website <em><a href="https://github.com/LeedsDataMill">source code</a></em> will be made open. The <em><a href="https://drive.google.com/a/leedsdatamill.org/folderview?id=0B7SuqXTi55XLWGJUMGFwcUVueEU&usp=drive_web">documentation</a></em> is <em>open</em>. The <em><a href="https://trello.com/b/dV8iMJrH/leeds-data-mill">timelines</a></em> are open. The challenge is open.</i></p>
							<p>How will you use it?</p>

						<header>
							<div class="img"><img src="<?php echo get_template_directory_uri(); ?>/css/i/section-2-bkg.jpg" alt="" class="jpg"></div>
							<h1>Why it exists</h1>
							<p>Data is changing how we see the world around us, and Governments across the globe have embraced the movement and revolutionised the way we understand the cities we live in.</p>
						</header>
						<section>
							<p>Anonymised Government data is now published by default on <a href="data.gov.uk">data.gov.uk</a> for everyone to use, and this transparency has shown that a national commitment to data publishing creates real opportunity.   </p>
							<p>By developing an Open Data platform for Leeds, we&#8217;re seizing the chance to do something unique. This is to create a city-wide culture of data publishing and experimentation, with the shared aim of improving life in the city for us all. </p>
							<p>Once an attitude of openness and collaboration becomes second nature to organisations and citizens, the stage will be set to do incredible things that can improve lives.</p>
							<p>This is why Leeds Data Mill exists.</p>

							<h1>What it will achieve</h1>
							<p>The aim of Leeds Data Mill is to kick-start a new generation of data-driven citizens and businesses who will share and explore information to bring value and benefit to everyone within the city. </p>
						</header>
						<section>
							<p>It&#8217;s also hoped that the success of the project will change the perception some people have about data in the public domain. </p>
							<p>This is not about Big Brother watching us, as the data added won&#8217;t include personal information. It&#8217;s about sharing anonymised data about our city that has the potential to teach us more about ourselves and the city in which we live and work.     </p>

							<h1>Who it&#8217;s for</h1>
							<p>Put simply, Leeds Data Mill is for everyone with an interest or involvement in the city they&#8217;re part of.</p>
						</header>
						<section>
							<p>The website is for data owners from organisations and businesses who will be empowered to upload their data in open formats, which can then be used to define the future of the city. <a href="http://illustreets.co.uk/explore-england/leeds/">Here&#8217;s just one example of how Open Data can be used to help people</a>.</p>
							<p>It&#8217;s also for the web developers, data scientists, app developers, graphic designers, and storytellers with the skills to transform data into apps, websites, visualisations or analysis that others can use.  </p>
							<p>And of course, it&#8217;s for the citizens of Leeds to learn more about their city; how Open Data can help them understand it better and improve their lives.</p>
							<p>By bringing data together from across the city, the site becomes a rich resource of stories yet to be told. </p>

							<h1>About Leeds Data Mill</h1>
							<p>Leeds Data Mill is led by Mark Barrett, an Open Data expert who created the first Open Data app to get to number 1 in the iTunes chart (using 42m pieces of data). He has also managed over 4,000 datasets at the NHS, and in 2013 was recognised as one of the fifty most innovative people in healthcare.</p>
						</header>
						<section>
							<p>As an active member of the Leeds data community, and a co-founder of Leeds Data Thing, <a href="http://barrettmark.com">Mark</a> saw for himself the wealth of expertise, talent, and enthusiasm for data within the city.</p>
							<p>His vision was to create an Open Data platform for Leeds &#8211; a central website holding Open Data from public and private sector &#8211; a first in the world, putting Leeds at the forefront of the movement. This meant removing the barriers that prevent organisations from uploading their data (costs, time, resource), and allowing others to access and develop this rich data in any way they want to.</p>
							<p>Leeds City Council has been a fantastic supporter of the project from the outset, and provided the initial investment and commitment needed to help make this happen. However, the project is a &#8220;citizen empowered&#8221; project that Mark and the wider Leeds data community can drive in a way that's by the city, for the city.</p>
